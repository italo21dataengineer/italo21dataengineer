I was responsible for collecting and analyzing customer data to identify patterns and trends, which ultimately led to recommendations for improving marketing strategies and customer engagement. In addition to that, I honed my analytical skills and learned how to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders through clear and concise reports and presentations.<br><br>Confident in my academic background and practical skills, I believe I am well-suited to thrive in the Data Analytics and Machine Learning realms.
